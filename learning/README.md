# Learning

We execute the `MLinter - CodeBERT.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
We use Google Drive to store our datasets and the results of the experiments.

To run the notebook using Google Colab, you need to have the following tree structure in your Google Drive:
- MLinter/
  - dataset/ : put the zipped datasets generated for each rule
  - utils/ : copy the content of the `utils` folder

The results of the experiments are stored in the `MLinter/result` folder.

It is possible to parallelize the execution by updating lines 15 and 16 of the last cell in the notebook.
